# Terraria World Analyzer (python)
Uses lihzahrd lib to read wdl. save files and then displays color coded map of the world with pygame.
# Displays only solid colors, no textures
If you need to look at your Terraria worlds just use TEdit, but if for some reason you want to use this just take the exe. file, it runs without any libraries or python installed.
The color pallet is the same as Tedit taken from their settings.xml (although not everything is the same, also lacks specific furniture IDs).
